# Hierarchical Clustering

* Hierarchical clustering, is an algorithm that groups similar objects into groups called clusters.

* At starting each observation is viewed as a separate cluster. Then it performs the following two steps repeatedly: 
1. find the two clusters that are the closest.
2. combine the two clusters that are the most similar.

* The distance between two clusters has been computed based on the length of the straight line drawn from one cluster to another.

* The basic method to generate hierarchical clustering are:
1. Agglomerative (We will focus on this one) and
2. Divisive
