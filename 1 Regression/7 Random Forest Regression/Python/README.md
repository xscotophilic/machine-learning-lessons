# Solve Random Forest Regression in python
> This program preprocesses the data and applies Random Forest Regression.

#### As the name suggests, this algorithm creates the forest with a number of Decision trees.

#### In general, the more trees in the forest the more robust the forest looks like. In the same way in the random forest regressor, the higher the number of trees in the forest gives the high the accuracy results.

* Each tree is created from a different sample of rows and at each node, a different sample of features is selected for splitting.

* Each of the trees makes its own individual prediction. 

* These predictions are then averaged to produce a single result.

* The averaging makes a Random Forest better than a single Decision Tree hence improves its accuracy and reduces overfitting.
