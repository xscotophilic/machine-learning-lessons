# Deep Learning Basics

> Deep Learning, is just a type of Machine Learning, inspired by the structure of a human brain.

- Deep learning algorithms analyze data with a predetermined logical structure in order to reach similar conclusions as humans.

- Deep learning uses a multi-layered structure of algorithms called neural networks.

- The neural network's architecture is focused on the structure of the human brain.

- Just as we use our brains to recognize patterns and categorize various types of information, neural networks can be trained to do the same with data.
