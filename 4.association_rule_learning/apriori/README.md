# Apriori Algorithm

### Apriori Property -> All non-empty subset of frequent itemset must be frequent.

- Apriori Algorithm
1. Set a minimum support and confidence
2. Take all the subsets in transactions having higher support than minimum support
3. Take all the rules of these subsets having higher confidence than minimum confidence
4. Generate the candidate set by joining the frequent itemset from the previous stage.
5. Perform subset testing and prune the candidate set if thereâ€™s an infrequent itemset contained or does not satisfy minimum support.
6. Repeat step 4 and 5 for given iterations.
