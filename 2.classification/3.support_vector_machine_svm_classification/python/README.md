# Solve Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification in Python
> This program preprocesses the data and applies SVM Classification.

*  The goal of the support vector machine algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that distinctly classifies the data points. Email spam or not spam, fraud or not fraud are some of the examples of classification problems.

* To differentiate the two groups of data points, there are several potential hyperplanes that could be selected. And we have to find a plane that has the maximum distance between data points of both classes. As shown in example.

* Hyperplanes are judgement boundaries that help define the data points. Data points falling on either side of the hyperplane may be assigned to various groups.
