* We can not find a straight line in this scenario to separate apples from lemons.

* The basic aspect is that if a data set in the current dimensions is inseparable, add another dimension, maybe the data will be separable in that way.

* Mapping to Higher Dimensions: 

We should not just blindly incorporate another dimension to solve this problem, we should transform the space such that we actively create this degree differential.
