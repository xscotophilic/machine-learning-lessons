# Solve Logistic Regression Classification in R Language
> This program preprocesses the data and applies Logistic Regression.

* Logistic regression is an algorithm for classification used to assign a discrete set of classes to observations. Email spam or not spam, fraud or not fraud are some of the examples of classification problems.

* Logistic Regression is a machine learning algorithm, a predictive analysis algorithm focused on the idea of probability, which is used for classification problems.

* We use the Sigmoid function to map expected values to probabilities. The function maps every real value between 0 and 1.

* Linear regression is used to predict the continuous dependent variable using a given set of independent variables. 

* Logistic Regression is used to predict the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables.
