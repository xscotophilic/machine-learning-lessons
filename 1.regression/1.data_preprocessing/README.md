# Data preprocessing

- Data preprocessing is a process in which raw data are prepared and adapted to a model of machine learning. It is the first and essential phase in the development of a model for master learning.

- A data from the real world usually includes sounds, lack of values and, sometimes, an unsuitable format not directly used for machine learning models. In order to clean and make the data appropriate for a machine learning model, data preparation needs to be carried out that also boosts the accuracy and efficiency of the machine learning model.

- It involves below steps:
  - Getting the dataset
  - Importing libraries
  - Importing datasets
  - Finding Missing Data
  - Encoding Categorical Data
  - Splitting dataset into training and test set
  - Feature scaling
