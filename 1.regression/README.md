# Regression

- Regression models are used to predict a continuous value.

  - Regression estimates the relationship between the target and the independent variable.
  - It is used to find the trends in data.
  - It helps to predict real/continuous values

- Terminologies Related to the Regression Analysis:

  1. Dependent Variable: The dependent variable is the main factor in regression analysis that we wish to predict or understand. It's also known as a target variable.

  2. Independent Variable: An independent variable, often known as a predictor, is a factor that affects the dependent variables or is used to predict the values of the dependent variables.

  3. Outliers are those who stand out from the crowd. In compared to other observed values, an outlier is an observation with an extremely low or very high value. An outlier can skew the results, thus it's best to avoid them.
