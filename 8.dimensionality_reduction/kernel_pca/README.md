# Kernel PCA

> kernel principal component analysis (kernel PCA) is an extension of principal component analysis (PCA) using techniques of kernel methods. Using a kernel, the originally linear operations of PCA are performed in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space.

- Given any algorithm that can be expressed solely in terms of dot products, this trick allows us to construct different nonlinear versions of it.
