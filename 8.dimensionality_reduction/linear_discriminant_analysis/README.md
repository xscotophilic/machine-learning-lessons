# Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

> Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), also known as normal discriminant analysis (NDA) or discriminant function analysis, is a generalization of Fisher's linear discriminant, a method used in statistics and other fields to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events.

- Assume we plotted a relationship between two variables, with each color representing a different class.

- If we want to reduce the number of dimensions to one, one option is to project everything onto the x-axis.

- Linear Discriminant Analysis, on the other hand, uses the information from both features to create a new axis and projects the data onto the new axis.
